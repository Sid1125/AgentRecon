Here's the summary of the results:\n\n- **Ping Scan**: Completed in 0.25s with no hosts down.\n- **DNS Resolution**: Completed in 13.00s with no errors or failures.\n- **Connect Scan**:\n  - Open ports found:\n    - Port 22: Open (State: open), Service: ssh\n    - Port 80: Open (State: open), Service: http\n  - Scanning completed in 0.26s.\n\nSo, the target IP address has two open ports:\n- Port 22 is open and running SSH service.\n- Port 80 is open and running HTTP service."
